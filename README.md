# Human Activity Recognition

## Overview

The **Human Activity Recognition** project aims to classify human activities based on sensor data collected from smartphones. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model training to achieve high accuracy in activity classification.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to develop a reliable system for recognizing human activities in real-time using smartphone sensor data. This capability can be applied in various domains, including health monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart home automation.

## Benefits

- **Real-Time Activity Recognition**: Enables applications to recognize and respond to user activities in real-time.
- **Health Monitoring**: Facilitates tracking of physical activities for health and fitness applications.
- **Smart Home Integration**: Automates home systems based on user activities.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load training and testing datasets from CSV files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features, and perform dimensionality reduction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the distribution of activities and relationships between features.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Train a LightGBM classifier to predict activities based on sensor data.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize the results of the analysis and model performance.

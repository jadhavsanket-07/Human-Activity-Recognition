# Human Activity Recognition

## Overview

The **Human Activity Recognition** project aims to classify human activities based on sensor data collected from smartphones. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model training to achieve high accuracy in activity classification.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load training and testing datasets from CSV files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features, and perform dimensionality reduction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the distribution of activities and the relationships between features.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Train a LightGBM classifier to predict activities based on sensor data.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize the results of the analysis and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- LightGBM
